Smart Agriculture Platform using IoT, Machine Learning, Flutter & Streamlit

📌 Project Overview

AgroTech Hub is an integrated smart agriculture solution that combines IoT-based real-time field monitoring, Machine Learning predictive analytics, and a Flutter mobile application.
The system collects environmental and soil data using IoT devices, processes it in the cloud, and applies ML algorithms to generate intelligent insights such as irrigation recommendations, crop disease prediction, and yield forecasting.
A Streamlit web application is used to integrate and visualize the ML model outputs, providing a comprehensive analytics dashboard.

🎯 Problem Statement

Farmers lack access to real-time monitoring, predictive insights, and direct digital advisory systems, which leads to low productivity and inefficient resource utilization.

AgroTech Hub aims to bridge this gap using technology-driven smart agriculture solutions.

🛠 Technologies Used
Flutter – Mobile application development
Streamlit – ML model integration and web dashboard
Machine Learning – Predictive analytics
IoT (ESP32 / Arduino) – Real-time data collection
Firebase / Cloud Database – Data storage and authentication

🤖 Machine Learning Model

The ML model is used for:
Crop yield prediction
Disease detection
Irrigation recommendation

Algorithms Used:
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine
K-Nearest Neighbors
The model is trained using agricultural and environmental datasets and integrated into the system using Streamlit for visualization and prediction.

🔄 System Workflow
IoT sensors collect soil and environmental data
Data is transmitted to cloud storage
ML model processes the data
Predictions and recommendations are generated
Results are displayed in the Streamlit dashboard and Flutter mobile app

Farmers take data-driven actions
